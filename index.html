<h1>SAGU - Simple Amazon Glacier Uploader</h1>
<hr>
<br>

<p>
    Amazon Glacier is a long-term persistent file-storage system for cold data storage. <br>As a GUI wrapper for the
    Glacier command line tools, The Simple Amazon Glacier Uploader aims to be an
    upload and download solution that is as durable as your data.<br> SAGU is a single .jar file Glacier interface
    written in Java for
    cross-platform accessibility. The use of Java assures that you will have access to your files regardless of your
    operating system
    when it is time to retrieve your data.<br>

</p>
<p>
    -Fix issue with errors downloading from servers other than US East.<br>

</p>
<p>
    -Bug-patch: File descriptions under 0.74.2 were getting uploaded with a "?" character as a result of the Unicode
    cleaning. Fixed. Check Glacier.txt and Glacier.csv for file descriptions of files uploaded under 0.74.2.<br>
</p>

<p>
    2012/10/02 - Version 0.74.2
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br>


<p>
    2012/09/24 - Version 0.74.1
</p>
<p>
    -Inventory request is saved as format "[vaultname][requesteddatetime].txt" now.<br>
    -Minor misc. fixes.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/22 - Version 0.74
</p>
<p>
    -Request a vault inventory from AWS. Current version is rough. Saves unparsed response to file.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(NB: This is not a replacement for maintaining a local log file. Amazon does not store named
    files, only ArchiveID's. Archives uploaded with previous versions of SAGU have included the filename as a
    descriptor, but archives uploaded with other programs may not. Use the inventory retrieval tool to acquire the
    Archive ID's within a particular vault. It takes AWS approximately 4 hours to prepare your inventory for
    download.)<br>
    -Various fixes.<br>
    -Updated AWS Java SDK to 1.3.21.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/20 - SAGU goes Git!
</p>
<p>
    -Development stall for a couple of days while I learned Git.<br>
    -Check out the public repository here: <a href="https://github.com/brianmcmichael/SAGU">
    SAGU Source at Github</a><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/15 - Version 0.73
</p>
<p>
    -Masked secret key.<br>
    -Added a button to refresh vaults.<br>
    -Added logo.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/11 - Version 0.72
</p>
<p>
    -Updated AWS SDK to 1.3.19.<br>
    -Removed 4GB file limit. The updated SDK should allow for files larger than 4GB. Please report errors.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/09 - Version 0.71
</p>
<p>
    -Enhancements to upload bar. See what's uploading and what's done.<br>
    -Program now regenerates tree-hashes more frequently. Should result in fewer timeouts. <br>
    -Bug-fixes, code cleaning.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/06 - Version 0.7
</p>
<p>
    -The threaded update. UI no longer sticks during upload/download.<br>
    -Indeterminate progressbar added. To be enhanced in upcoming releases.<br>
    -Batch multiple upload requests at once, even to different servers.<br>
    -Have several download requests processing at once.<br>
    -UI tweaks and graphical assets.<br>
    -SAGU now creates a Glacier.log file, a Glacier.txt file, and a Glacier.csv file by default.<br>
    -Glacier.log files are intended to be parsed by future versions of the program and for export. .txt files and .csv
    files are for viewing convenience.<br>
    -OSX users should select the option to view .txt files to prevent logs from opening in the console.<br>
    -<strong>Known Bug:</strong> Progress bar disappears during multiple uploads if one completes first. This is
    cosmetic. The process still continues in the background until completed or until an error is received. This will be
    corrected in an update.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/04 - Version 0.62
</p>
<p>
    -Select upload vault from existing. Selecting a server location populates a dropdown with existing vaults on that
    server.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/09/02 - Version 0.61
</p>
<p>
    -Ability to export logs.<br>
    -Improved file selection for download mode in OSX.<br>
    -Choose log output (.log, .txt, .csv)<br>
    -Save log output preferences and reload on restart.<br>
</p>

</p>
<p>
    -UI redesign.<br>
    -Download support (Currently Experimental - Unthreaded)<br>
    -Create vault.<br>
    -Updated AWS libraries.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/08/29 - Version 0.52
</p>
<p>
    -Bug-Fixes.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/08/28 - Version 0.51
</p>
<p>
    -Better multi-file support. <br>
    -Better error handling.<br>
    -Files are now being hosted on dropbox to take some load off of my shared hosting.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/08/27 - Version 0.5.
</p>
<p>
    -Added multiple file upload with drag and drop support. Be careful with this. Glacier is not a second hard drive, it
    works by uploading single files and downloading or deleting by ArchiveID. Amazon does not provide a method to
    retreive ArchiveID's right now, so your log files are your access to your files. I would recommend zipping large
    numbers of files together and uploading them as a single file. <br>
    -Even better logging! Switched from DataOutput UTF to Writer. Logs should now have standardized layouts and no
    machine characters. (I recommend saving your old log elsewhere and letting the program generate a new one. Your old
    log is fine, but some text viewers get confused by dataoutput.)<br>
    -Added simple notification bar that appears when program is uploading. Progress bar and threading planned in near
    future.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    2012/08/26 - Version 0.4.
</p>
<p>
    -Added delete archive function. Set AWS Keys and Location/Vault, then insert Archive ID to delete.<br>
    -Saves preferences to "SAGU.properties" in launch folder and reloads settings on launch.<br>
    -Built with Java 1.6 libraries. Java 7 no longer required. <br>
    -Set executable bit for Linux/OSX.<br>
    -Maintenance fix to logging. ArchiveID's logged under v0.2-0.3 contain an extra "Å " character at the beginning which
    was a rogue Java artifact. (SAGU will automatically handle this if entered, but users should remove the antecedent Å 
    in early logs if using the archiveID with other utilities.)<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
    2012/08/25 - Version 0.3.
</p>

<p>
    -Direct links to AWS Key Page, Glacier Vault Creation, Log file, SAGU Update site.<br>
    -Enable right-click to copy/paste.<br>
</p>
<p>
    2012/08/24 - Version 0.2.
</p>
<p>
    -Upload Logging! <br>
    -Logging is enabled by default. Saves to Glacier.log in program directory.<br>
    -Log contains Archive ID, Filename, Vault Name, Upload Date<br>
    -ArchiveID will be useful for deleting or retreiving individual archives.<br>
</p>
<p>
    2012/08/23 - Version 0.1.
</p>
<p>
    -Ability to upload a single file at a time to the Glacier service. <br>
    -Requires Security Credentials from Amazon AWS Console. <br>
    <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials">https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials</a><br>
    -Requires you to create a vault at the Glacier Console. <br>
    <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/glacier/home">https://console.aws.amazon.com/glacier/home</a><br>
    -Select hosting location via dropdown.<br>
    -Select single file.<br>
    -Upload file to selected vault/server.<br>
    -(Amazon Glacier inventory is updated approximately once per day. It may take 24 hours for your files to
    appear.)<br>
